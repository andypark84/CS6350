# CS6350
This is a machine learning library developed by Andrew Park for  CS5350/6350 in University of Utah.
# Linear Regression
For the Linear Regression, when you run the run.sh file, it will run the functions train_bgd(lr), test_bgd(), and test_sgd() sequentially.
The function train_bgd(lr) will plot the graphs of convergence and return the learned weight vectors for each of the learning rates(1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125).
The function test_bgd() will make a prediction of the test data using the learning rate(0.5) and return the learned weight vetor.
The function test_sgd() will plot the graph of the cost function and return learned weight vector and cost of the test data.
